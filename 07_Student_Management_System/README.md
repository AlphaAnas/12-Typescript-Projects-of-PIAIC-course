# Student Management System in Typescript


This project is a simple console-based Student Management System written in TypeScript. It includes features such as adding new students, generating unique student IDs, enrolling students in courses, viewing student records, paying tuition fees, and displaying student details. The project utilizes `chalk` for colored terminal output and `inquirer` for interactive command-line prompts.

5. **Pay Tuition Fees**: Pay the tuition fees for a student.
6. **Show Student Status**: Display the details of a student, including name, ID, courses enrolled, and balance.
