## Technologies Used
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- **Inquirer**: A collection of common interactive command-line user interfaces.
- **Various TypeScript Dependencies**: Including libraries and tools that facilitate the development of TypeScript applications.

## Compiling and Running on IDE

When all the dependencies are successfully installed, you can build and run the project using the below-mentioned command:
```sh
tsc && node index.js
